# MLP-Scheduling-Predictor_OSPROJ

This project uses a **neural network (MLP)** to predict the best **CPU scheduling algorithm** for a given set of processes based on their arrival and burst times.

It was developed as a final project for the Operating Systems course at HUT.
---

## Project Goal

To **automatically predict the optimal scheduling algorithm** (with the lowest total waiting time) from among:

- `FCFS` (First Come First Serve)
- `SJF` (Shortest Job First)
- `RR` (Round Robin, with quantum = 4)

The prediction is made using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** neural network built with **PyTorch**.

---

## Dataset

The dataset consists of **1200 samples**, each with:
- Arrival times for 4 processes
- Burst times for 4 processes
- A label indicating the best scheduling algorithm for that sample

The labels are generated by computing and comparing total waiting time for all three algorithms. Tie-breaking follows these rules:
- If `FCFS` and `SJF` tie → label is `FCFS`
- If `FCFS` and `RR` tie → label is `RR`
- If `SJF` and `RR` tie → label is `SJF`

---

## Model Architecture

- **Input:** 8 features (4 arrival times + 4 burst times)
- **Model:** MLP with 2 hidden layers
- **Output:** 3 classes (FCFS, SJF, RR)
- **Loss Function:** CrossEntropyLoss
- **Optimizer:** Adam

## Results

- Accuracy achieved: ~85-90% on test data
- Visualization of training loss and accuracy using `matplotlib`
